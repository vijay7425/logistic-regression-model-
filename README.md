# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a logistic regression model. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of the following columns:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Ticket fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
